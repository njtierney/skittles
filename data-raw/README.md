# README

This data was collected to explore whether a sample of 3 people could
identify the flavour of skittles while blindfolded.

## Method

Participant is seated down at a table wearing a blindfold.
There were 2 skittles of the 5 colours in a bowl in front of them.
They would have a drink of water, select a skittle at random, for the examiner 
to record. The examiner would then align the row with the corresponding colour about to be eaten by the participant, in the data, the numbers 1-5 in the far left column corresponded to the skittle type.

- 1: Red
- 2: Orange
- 3: Yellow
- 4: Green
- 5: Purple

Their best guess at the flavour/colour was given, and the order it was guessed was also recorded by the examiner.

10 skittles, 2 of each colour/flavour were given to each participant.
There were 3 participants.

The raw data is recorded in `data-raw/skittles-raw.csv`.
